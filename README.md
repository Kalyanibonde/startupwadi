=======
1. StartupWadi will serve as a dedicated venue for individuals or groups to work on their startup ideas, significant projects, or strategies. This will foster creativity and innovation in a conducive environment.

2. The venue will offer all necessary amenities, such as quiet rooms, an amphitheater, sleeping accommodations, food services, and other resources tailored to support productive work sessions.

3. The core objective is to encourage young individuals, such as students, to step away from their routine activities—like attending college—and spend time at Startup Wadi to introspect and refine their unique, innovative ideas.

4. Revenue generated from bookings will be used to support individuals who cannot afford the services, ensuring inclusivity and contributing to society as a whole.

5. StartupWadi will collaborate with Paani Foundation to host and organize their training programs, further broadening the venue's impact.

6. The StartupWadi website will streamline the prebooking process, allowing users to specify their requirements in advance, making the process seamless and efficient.

7. With the anticipated increase in booking requests, resources will be allocated on a first-come, first-served basis, ensuring fair access to the venue’s facilities.

8. Talking about the long term goal, once StartupWadi secures FCPA and FCRA approvals, it will become eligible for funding from both national and international sources, with the ultimate goal of transforming Startup Wadi into a fully-fledged pre-incubation center supported by various stakeholders.

9. StartupWadi aims to establish centers in each district, making the initiative accessible to a broader audience, and the website design will include an option for users to select their preferred district, anticipating future scalability.

- At the moment 26 types of programs are being designed exclusively for StartupWadi

10. We will be organising an in-house hackathon (tentativley 48 hours) which will provide innovative inputs and accelerate development.

By fostering collaboration, innovation, and inclusivity, Startup Wadi aims to become a cornerstone for entrepreneurial growth and societal impact.
